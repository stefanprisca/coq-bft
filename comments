------------------------------
- Managed to produce some examples but only on a system with no faulty replicas....
- Restarted because I got stuck. The big system was too complex and I could not connect the theorems to the implementation
- Started bft2 = a dump implementation. Managed to state a StateValid property (more or less) on the systems
  - managed to define the faulty/nonfaulty replicas and their function.

Problems: 
1) Had some problems with the replicas - had to define them inductively and then have a single function which changes behavior based on this.
    This made it easier to recurse on them in the proofs.
2) Still have to figgure out how to connect the output of a replica to the sequence number obtained in the state.
